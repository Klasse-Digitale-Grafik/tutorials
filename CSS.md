# CSS Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is a method to assign styles to structured content like HTML. This allows you to seperate the appeareance from the actual content.
More on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## üõ∑ Basics

```css
selector {
    /* comment */
    property: value;
}
```

### Selectors
The most important selectors are:
- `*` select all
- `tagname` select elements by tag name
- `.class` select elements by class name
- `#id` select element**s** by id
- `:pseudo` select elements that are in a special state like `:hover`, or pseudo children like `:before`
- `[attr]` select elements that have a given attribute
- `parent descendant` select elements inside some other elements
- `parent > child` select elements that are direct children of given parent elements
- `element1 ~ element2` select elements that eventually follow some other elements
- `element1 + element2` select elements that directly follow some other elements
- `element1, element2` combine multiple selectors

### Rules
There are various rules that you can apply to your element to control its appeareance.
```css
h1 {
    color: red;
    font-family: monospace;
    text-align: center;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    margin: 0.5rem;
    padding: 0.5em;
    border: 1px solid blue;
    border-radius: 0.5em;
    text-shadow: 0 0 10px blue;
}
```
[Full list of CSS Rules](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp)

### Cascading and inheritance
One of CSS‚Äô key characteristics is the power of inheritance, which means:
1. A selector always selects all matching elements.
2. All rules applied to an element will populate down to all it‚Äôs children ("cascading"), as long as they‚Äôre not overwritten.
3. With the `inherit` value, child elements can explicitly inherit a rule from its ancestors.

### Units
Most common CSS units are:
- `px` pixels in non-retina terms (1x1 CSS px = 2x2 retina pixels)
- `%` relative to the **width** of the parent element
- `vw` % of screen width
- `vh` % of screen height (see ["100vh-problem"](https://css-tricks.com/the-trick-to-viewport-units-on-mobile/))
- `em` relative to current font size (`2em` means `200%` of the current or inherited font-size)
- `rem` [relative to root font size](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_pxtoemconversion.asp) (when `html{font-size:10px;}`, then `1rem` = `10px`)
- `color` as `#hex`, `rgb()` or `rgba()`

Units can also be calculated by the browser, eg: `width: calc( 50vw + 1px );`

### Bringing CSS into HTML
Basically, there are 3 standard ways to [attach CSS to your HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp):

**Inline**, using `style` attribute (use only for small exceptions of the rule)
```html
<h1 style="color: red;">Headline</div>
```

**Within HTML `head`** (use for small stylesheets)
```html
<head>
    <style>
        h1 { color: red; }
    </style>
```

**Seperate `.css` file**, referenced from within the HTML `head` (normal usecase)
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

## üì± Responsive design and media queries
Using media queries, you can control that certain CSS code gets only applied, when the user device matches a specific rule. This is helpful to adjust a website design for small or large screens or when it‚Äôs being printed.

```css
/* on small screens show items as list */
.grid .item {
    margin: 1rem;
    background-color: grey;
}
@media (min-width: 600px){
    /* on medium sized screens, show 2 column grid */
    .grid {
        display: grid;
        gap: 1rem;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    }
    .grid .item {
        margin: 0;
    }
}
@media (min-width: 900px){
    /* on large screens, show 4 column grid */
    .grid {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    }
}
```

You can also add seperate stylesheets that only will be loaded, once the media query matches:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="global.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="screen.css" media="screen">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="scree-large.css" media="screen and (min-width: 900px)">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" media="print">
```

- [Hyphenation]((https://medium.com/clear-left-thinking/all-you-need-to-know-about-hyphenation-in-css-2baee2d89179)) and [word breaks](https://justmarkup.com/articles/2015-07-31-dealing-with-long-words-in-css/)

**Mobile first paradigm**
means that you first define all the rules required for the layout on a mobile device and later add or override the design for larger screens using media queries or a second css file. This makes sense because usually devices with larger screens have more compute power and faster internet than smaller devices.

## üé® CSS Variables
With CSS variables you can make your design more modular and changable, even on the client-side:
```css
::root {
    /* define */
    --signature-color: #00f;
}
button, a, h1 {
    /* use */
    color: var(--signature-color);
}
```

    font-family: 'MyWebFont';
    src: url('/path/to/webfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
        url('/path/to/webfont.woff') format('woff');
}
```

## üö® Browser support and default values
Not all rules and features are supported by all browsers. Some rules are even interpreted differently across browsers. Especially for new or fancy features, you should check for browser support:

- [CanIUse Archive of browser support](https://caniuse.com)
- [Supported rules](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_browsersupport.asp)

Sometimes browsers (especially older versions) ignore a rule and only apply it when you add a ["vendor-prefix"](https://bitsofco.de/css-vendor-prefixes/):
```css
element {
    -webkit-animation-name: slidein;
    -moz-animation-name: slidein;
    -ms-animation-name: slidein;
    -o-animation-name: slidein;
    animation-name: slidein;
}
```
In 2021, this is less of a problem compared to a few years ago. But to support older browsers, it can still be helpful. There are also tools like [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io) that can do it for you.

All browsers come with a default stylesheet, which provides fallback styles for many HTML elements. As these fallback rules are different accross browsers and even can be edited by the user, it often makes sense to "reset" or "normalize" them before you add your own rules:
- [List of browser default values](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_default_values.asp)
- [Reboot, Resets, Rereasoning](https://css-tricks.com/reboot-resets-reasoning/) by Chris Coyer
- [Eric Meyer CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
- [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

The most basic CSS reset would be
```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    border: none;
    font: inherit;
    list-style: none;
    color: inherit;
    background-color: none;
    vertical-align: baseline;
}
```
which you can add on top of all your css to resets (almost) all default rules that could mess up your design.

## üõ† Tooling and Preprocessors
There are several tools, that can help you to make your CSS work easier. Preprocessors allow you to write your css in a more readable and reusable way and then compile it to real css that browsers can handle:
- [Sass/Scss](https://sass-lang.com)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org)

## üß© Frameworks
When you don‚Äôt want to handle every edge case yourself, a CSS framework could help. This is especially helpful for grid systems, forms and user interfaces:

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) framework
- [Pure.css](https://purecss.io) framework
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) framework
- [Reflex](https://reflexgrid.com) grid system
