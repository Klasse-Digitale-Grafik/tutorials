# (S)FTP

FTP or SFTP lets you connect to the filesystem of a remote server, to upload or download files. Read more at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol)

SFTP is the secure alternative of FTP and is currently the standard for most servers or providers.

## Getting started

To connect to a remote server via FTP, you will need:
- The host domain or IP-Adress
- A username
- A password

And sometimes
- a remote path

You can do it using the command line, but a client software will make it much easier for you. Some example could be:

- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io). Free, Mac, Windows
- [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org). Free, Mac, Windows

## Example using Cyberduck

1. Prepare your login credentials and open Cyberduck
2. Click on `New Connection` or `Neue Verbindung`
3. A new window pops up, enter your credentials:
    - Select your Protocol, SFTP or FTP
    - Put server address (host or IP)
    - Your username
    - The password
4. Click on connect
