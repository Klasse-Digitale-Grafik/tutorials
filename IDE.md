# Code Editor or IDE (Integrated development environment)

Software programming means to notate instructions for a computer or machine to exectute. While there are other types of programming, this often is done by writing code in some text format. For many programming languages, the code can be written in some unformatted `UTF-8` text file, that just carries a special file extension like `.html`, `.css` or `.js` to indicate how it should be interpreted.

While it is technically possible to write such code in a regular text editor, it might be much more comfortable to use some special code editor that assists in writing code. E.g. by offering a monospaced typeface, syntax highlighting, auto completions, cool color themes, code formatters, git integration and of course various ways to extend it via plugins.
