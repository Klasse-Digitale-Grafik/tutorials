# Git version control and GitHub

**Git** is a version control system for text and code projects (`repositories` or `repo`). For every completed milestone or task you can make a `commit`. You can also make `branches` to create different versions or states of your work. The main state of your project can be either locally on your computer or on your own server or on some platform like GutHub, BitBucket or GitLab. A really important feature is, that the whole editing history will be kept.

**GitHub** is an online plaform, where Git users can manage their projects in the cloud. So you can get (`clone`) a repo, work on it locally and later `push` your work to the central source of truth.
A Platform like GitHub offers the possibility, that many users can collaborate on one project.

## ðŸŽ‰ Getting started

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

2. Open your terminal and navigate somewhere where you want to work, e.g. `cd hfbk`. Or juyt type `cd ` and drag a folder from you finder into the terminal, hit enter.

3. Get a clone of this very repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Klasse-Digitale-Grafik/tutorials.git
```
Once that is done, close the terminal and navigate to that newly created folder (e.g. `hfbk/tutorials`)

4. Open that folder in your code editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code or Atom) and start editing this tutorial and make it better :)

5. Once youâ€™re done, look around in your Editor for "Git", "Version Control", "GitHub" or something. There will be a list of all the files you have edited. You can select them to `stage` them, in order to prepare them for a `commit`

6. Type in a short commit message that helps someone else to understand what you did. Click on `commit`.

7. You now created a new state of the project, but it is still on your computer. Look around for a `push` or `pull and push` button and click it. After a few seconds, your version of the project will be merged with the cloud version of the project.

8. Maybe this only works when having a GitHub Account

9. Go back to GitHub and check if you were successfull.
