# SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol to connect to a remote computer or server via the command line.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell))

## Connect to a remote host

You will need:
- The host name or IP address
- Username on that machine
- Password

1. Open your terminal and type
```
ssh {username}@{hostname or address}
# now you will be asked for the password
```
If everything worked well, thatâ€™s already it!

You can now operate on the remote machine just as you would on your local device.
For a quick introduction on how to get around, check out the [command line](CommandLine.md) tutorial.
