# JSON

Json is a format that structures JS objects and arrays so that they can be stored as file or sent around between several services. Common usecases are APIs or storing data in a quickly accessible format.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)

## File format

For objects:

```json
{
    "key1": "string value",
    "key2": 2,
    "key3": "0.999"
}
```

For arrays:

```json
[
    "string item",
    2,
    "0.999"
]
```

Items or values can either be of the `string` type (`"text"`), `int` (full numbers, e.g `2`). If you have other data tyepes like `float` (floating point numbers, like `0.999`), they will be converted to string, e.g. `"0.999"`.

For valid natotaion, you will have to use double quotes `"` and have no comma after that last entry.

## Working with JSON in PHP

JSON can be easily encoded and decoded with php using [json_decode](https://www.php.net/manual/de/function.json-decode.php) and [json_encode](https://www.php.net/manual/de/function.json-encode.php).

**Example 1)** Maybe you would like to open a local json file that you have on your server and decode that into a php array/object:
```php
$filename = 'path/to/file/data.json';
// check if file actually exists
if( file_exists( $filename ) ){
    $file = file_get_contents( $filename );
    $data = json_decode( $file, true );
} else {
    $data = [];
}
```

**Example 2)** Or maybe you want your server to return a JSON object that comes from some data you have in php, your own small API:
```php
$data = [
    'key1' => 'string value',
    'key2' => 2,
    'key3' => 0.999
];

// declare that the file type returned is a json
header('Content-Type: application/json');

echo json_encode( $data );

exit;
```

**Example 3)** Or maybe you want to bind that data object to a js variable that you can use on your website:
```php
<?php

$data = [
    'key1' => 'string value',
    'key2' => 2,
    'key3' => 0.999
];

?>
<script>
    const data = <?php echo json_encode( $data ); ?>
    console.log( data );
</script>
```

## Working with JSON in JavaScript

**Example 4)** If you want to access a remote API endpoint or if you created your own (see example 3), you can `fetch` that data using JS:
```js
async function fetch( url ) {
    const res = await this.fetch( url );
    const data = await res.json();
    console.log( data );
    if (res.ok) {
        return data;
    } else {
        throw new Error(data);
    }
}
let myFetchedData = fetch('https://...');
```
This example is a bit more complicated because of itâ€™s asynchronous nature. (The JS code above is executed, then your browser requests the remote url, then there comes some response, which then gets parsed as json, and only then the `myFetchedData` holds that data. Until then it is a `unresolved promise`).
