# Webhosting & Domain

A **website** and a **domain** are two different things: The **website is a collection** of files that can be rendered by your browser. These files are stored on some **server**, a computer that is always connected to the internet and which can be accessed by "calling" itâ€™s **IP address**. And then there is a domain, which redirects your request to that servers IP address. Because on one server with one IP address, there can be multiple websites, the domain is also used by the server to determine which directory of files should be delivered.

## ðŸŒ± The easy way
The easiest is to have domain, email and webhosting with one provider. Many providers call this product "webhosting", and often there is almost nothing that can go wrong:
- Buy a webhosting package and select an available domain
- Create an FTP user and upload your website to the webspace
- Go to domain settings and direct the domain to that directory where you uploaded the website
- (Set up an email address)

This kind of webhosting is mostly running Apache or nginx on a shared Linux machine and is suitable for simple websites made with HTML or generated with PHP, like Kirby or Wordpress.

### Specs
These are the specs that you should look for:
- Monthly cost
- Inclusive domains or SSL certificates?
- SSD disk storage with sufficient space
- CPU/RAM
- SFTP
- PHP >= 7.4
- Serverlocation (Germany/Europe)

Depending on your needs:
- Database
- Node.js
- SSH

## ðŸŒ³ More complex ways

There are various reasons, why you may end up with a more complicated setup, e.g.:
- You need more compute power, e.g. to handle many requests, a large database, many files, ...
- You want to execute other software, like Node.js, Python, Go, ...
- You want to use some fancy continous deploy (CI) workflow
- The domain shall remain with another provider (e.g. to retain existing email setup)
- The provider of choice doesnâ€™t offer the right hosting or the right domain
- You want to use special services like GitHub pages to host your website
- You want to install a whole environment, e.g. with Docker

## ðŸ“’ Glossary
- **(Web-)Hosting** often means an AMP-instance where you can run code (e.g. PHP) or databases and serve files (read more above)
- **Server** often means a (virtual) computer, that you can configure to your own needs. Of course you can also install a AMP environment to serve your website. But in some cases you will have install all the software yourself.
- **Managed** means that you donâ€™t have to configure the server software yourself via the command line, but the provider offers you a user-interface (e.g. Plesk) to configure the server behaviour and install software
- **Shared, virtual, vServer, VPS** means that you share the physical machine with other customers, which is the most common practice and also consumes less electricity
- **Dedicated** is the opposite of shared, meaning that you alone execute on one physical machine
- **Availability** % of time, the service/machine is accessable from the internet. 99.9% uptime means 45min downtime per month
- **AMP Stack** Apache + MySQL + PHP is the classic website software stack, required for Kirby or Wordpress-websites
- **JAM Stack** JavaScript + API Data + Markup (HTML) is the upcoming software stack, that runs a JS-Framework (Vue, React, Svelte or Angular) both on the server (Node.js) and client side, consumes itâ€™s content from some API and generates HTML from it
- **SSL certificates** are required to show your website via the `https://` protocol. Many providers charge an expensive premium for that, while others offer you unlimited Letâ€™s encrypt certificates. When domain and hosting are seperated, the certificate can be installed both on the domain or on the hosting side.
